            Haq, a Hindi courtroom drama released in 2025, features Yami Gautam Dhar alongside Emraan Hashmi in lead roles. The film, directed by Suparn Varma, centres on a woman’s determined fight to secure her legal rights. Although its theatrical run in November 2025 delivered only moderate box office results, the film has found renewed momentum after premiering on Netflix, where it has drawn favourable reactions for both its performances and its socially relevant theme.
